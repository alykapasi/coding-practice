    "### What is an array?\n",
    "> An array is a collection of items of the same type, stored contiguously in memory. A caveat to that is that python allows arrays to store anytype of item; `arr = ['a', \"apple\", 0, 0.25]` is a valid array in python, but most coding languages do not allow that, and in most cases it's best practice to not do that and use an alternative means of storage, either an object, a json or convert them all to one type (string).In a pure computer science sense, lists can store multiple types of items, while arrays can only store one type. In python arrays are implented as lists. Monotyped arrays can also be used in python, but need to be imported using the arrays package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> One key feature of python arrays is that they are dynamically sized. In most languages such as `C/C++` and `Java`, arrays have a fixed type (static typed), but in python items can be added indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The advantage of having dynamically sized arrays is that they are a lot easier to use and work with, but they are usually very inefficient in terms of memory. This is because when an element is added to the list the existing list is copied with the item(s) being added into a new larger list. And vice versa for when an element is being removed for the list. This essentially means the list's memory address is being changed everytime an element is added. This causes a lot of overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In most programming langauges, lists are indexed from 0, not 1. For people who aren't very familiar with computer science that might be a little un-intuitive, but there is a reason for that. That is because how the arrays are stored in memory is that the first index is considered 0 and each following element is addressed by the computer by adding the size of the item type. \n",

    "### Filling arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "> Arrays can also be filled in python a couple of ways, the first way is manually using the `+=` operator, a caveat is the item must be a list too, so if you want to add one item to a list it needs to be enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The next way is to use the `append()` or `insert()` method; `append()` inserts the item at the end of the list, while `insert()` inserts the item at the specified index.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A python-ic way of instantiating lists is to use list comprehension. This is when a list is generated containing all the values within a certain condition. This is a common functional programming technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `range()` function is very important for lists, as it generates a sequence of numbers. This is the most common way to populate lists. The range function takes between 1 and 3 arguments. If one argument is passed in like `range(10)` it will return a sequence `[0,10)`. If two arguments are passed as so\" `range(3,10)` the generated sequence will be `[3,10)`. If three elements are passed: `range(1,10,3)` the sequence generated will be `[1,4,7]`. Beacause `[1, 1+3, 1+3+3]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The first argument is the start of the sequence it's default value is 0. The second value is the end of the sequence and if only one value is passed, it is assigned to that argument. The third value is the step argument, it determines it should create the sequence with what step, it is 1 by default."
